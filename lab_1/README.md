# Let's start with the dot

Start by opening three tabs in our browser:
- Wetty: `http://<your-panda>.devopsplayground.org/wetty`
- VSCode text editor: `http://<your-panda>.devopsplayground.org:8000`
- Live Minecraft map: `http://<your-panda>.devopsplayground.org:8123`
## Configuring provider


Our very first step will be to define and configure our Terraform provider. Let's use our terminal to navigate to the directory where we will keep our Terraform code. You can do this by typing 
```bash
cd /home/playground/workdir/Terraform-X-Minecraft
```
In another VSCode tab, let's open our IDE and in the same directory create `terraform.tf` file. In this file we will define our terraform configuration, and for today's workshop all we need is our Minecraft provider. Copy the snippet below:
```go
terraform {
  required_providers {
    minecraft = {
      source  = "HashiCraft/minecraft"
      version = "0.1.1"
    }
  }
}
```
We'll work on a very simple use case today, but in more advanced configurations we may have multiple providers, as well as remote backend configured in this file

We instructed Terraform which version of the provider to use, so now we need to configure it. Create a `provider.tf` file in the same directory and populate it with the snippet below:
```go
provider "minecraft" {
  address  = "127.0.0.1:25575"
  password = "PandaTime"
}
```
In this case, we provide a password as a string, which, of course, is not advisable. Terraform can integrate with secret managing services (such as Hashicorp Vault), or use credentials from the environment (such as environment variables, aws credential file etc.)

Now we can initialise our provider by going back to the window with our terminal and executing
```bash
terraform init
```
The output should look like below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/tf-init.png" />
</p>

<b>Note</b> Terraform has created a hidden directory where the provider executable was downloaded, as well as the dependency file.

## Creating your first resource 

Our next step is to create and then deploy our first building block in Minecraft, using terraform resource. Let's create `main.tf` file in the `/home/playground/workdir/Terraform-X-Minecraft` directory. To define a resource, we need to provide the required input arguments. In this case, we need to define them all, but in different providers some or even all the inputs might be optional. Please use the coordinates as below, so you can follow your work in the view easier - you can access it at `<your-panda>.devopsplayground.org:8123`

```go
resource "minecraft_block" "stone" {
  material = "minecraft:stone"

  position = {
    x = 0,
    y = -60,
    z = 0,
  }
}

```
Once you saved the file, please run the following commands from your terminal (make sure that you are in the `/home/playground/workdir/Terraform-X-Minecraft` directory)
```bash
pwd # check if we are in the right directory
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
Note: you can auto apply using the following command instead of the ones above: `terraform apply --auto-approve`
After running Terraform, apply type `yes` to confirm the plan. Your output should look like below.
<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/tf-plan-apply.png" />
</p>

Once your plan is applied - please type the command below into the terminal (it will refresh the view of your world within the World Map tab in your browser):
```
render-flat
```
After ~60 seconds you should see your block at `<your-panda>.devopsplayground.org:8123`

## Terraform state
Once we applied the configuration - lets have a quick look on what kind sorcery Terraform did for us behind the scenes. Let's type:

```bash
ls-al
cat terraform.tfstate
```

Your output should look like below: 

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/tf-state.png" />
</p>

<b>Note</b>: Terraform created the state file where the current state of your infrastructure is captured. When running a plan - terraform will refer to the state to see how your desired state is different from your current state. The state can be configured to be stored remotely (i.e. Terraform Cloud/Enterprise, S3) so all your engineers have the same information to execute against. You can use `terraform state <option>` commands to manipulate your state.

## Using variables
Terraform is making the use of variables we can define and use in our configurations. Let's create a `variables.tf` file in the `/home/playground/workdir/Terraform-X-Minecraft` directory and paste the following:
```go
variable "block_material" {
    type = string
    default = "minecraft:stone"
    description = "Type of material you are using for your structure - different materials will have different colours"
}

variable "position" {
  type = object({
    x = number
    y = number
    z = number
  })

  default = {
    x = 0,
    y = -60,
    z = 0
  }
}
```
You can see that we can define simple variables like strings or integers as well as more complex objects. You can find more about inpout variables in the [documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables). Now we also need to edit our `main.tf` file to make use of our variables.
```go
resource "minecraft_block" "stone" {
  material = var.block_material

  position = {
    x = var.position.x,
    y = var.position.y,
    z = var.position.z,
  }
}
```
We can now run:
```
terraform plan
```
You should see no changes to do as our default value for the variable was the same as previously defined. That default values can be overriden - see the [documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables) to see more details and precedence they take. At the very top will be the CLI argument, so let's give it a try:
```bash
terraform plan -var='block_material=minecraft:gold_ore'
```
Your output should look like below:
<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/tf-var.png" />
</p>
We are not going to apply it just yet - first, we are going to add another resource to our `main.tf` file. It should look like below now:

```go
resource "minecraft_block" "block_one" {
  material = var.block_material

  position = {
    x = var.position.x,
    y = var.position.y,
    z = var.position.z,
  }
}

resource "minecraft_block" "block_two" {
  material = var.block_material

  position = {
    x = var.position.x + 10,
    y = var.position.y,
    z = var.position.z,
  }
}
```
<b>Note</b>: Each resource we create needs to have a unique name hence we have `block_one` and `block_two`. You can imagine how long our configuration will get when we start building something more complex, right? Don't worry - we will cover how to deal with this in the next labs! 
Please also note how in the 2nd block we used our variable with simple math, and therefore changed the coordinates for our block. We can run the apply command now, while overriding our `block_material` variable again.

```bash
terraform apply -var='block_material=minecraft:gold_ore'
```

Your output should look like below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/tf-apply-var.png" />
</p>

<b>Note</b>: This time our good old block was destroyed before we created a new one in its place. Your previous plan was suggesting the change in-place instead. This is because we change our resource name in the configuration. Certain operations will force the resources to be recreated, which might be crucial for your runs - i.e. changing a tag will be most likely change in place, while rewriting a bootstrap script for your virtual machine will most likely cause the recreation of the resource. This could have a cascading effect in bigger configuration.

Now lets refresh our world by running the below command and see the changes we made.

```bash
render-flat
```

You should see two blocks not so apart from each other. Time to make our first "structure" - the line. Please copy the snippet below to your `main.tf` file.

```go
resource "minecraft_block" "block_one" {
  material = var.block_material

  position = {
    x = var.position.x,
    y = var.position.y,
    z = var.position.z,
  }
}

resource "minecraft_block" "block_two" {
  material = var.block_material

  position = {
    x = var.position.x + 1,
    y = var.position.y,
    z = var.position.z,
  }
}

resource "minecraft_block" "block_three" {
  material = var.block_material

  position = {
    x = var.position.x + 2,
    y = var.position.y,
    z = var.position.z,
  }
}

resource "minecraft_block" "block_four" {
  material = var.block_material

  position = {
    x = var.position.x + 3,
    y = var.position.y,
    z = var.position.z,
  }
}
resource "minecraft_block" "block_five" {
  material = var.block_material

  position = {
    x = var.position.x + 4,
    y = var.position.y,
    z = var.position.z,
  }
}
```

Now lets run auto-apply:

```bash
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

Then refresh our world again:

```bash
render-flat
```

Your flat world view should look like below now:

That is it for the first lab! Time to take it up a notch and move to the [Lab_2 - I am going to build a wall...](../lab_2/README.md)!
